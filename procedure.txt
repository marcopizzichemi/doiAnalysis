PROCEDURE:
The DOI scan analysis procedure is described here. 
It consists in 
1) analyzing the individual datasets one by one with ModuleCalibration and proper conf files, to produce the histograms
2) run on the histogram files to extract the points (mean of the w histograms and z positions) and produce the final dataset

So you will need to have ModuleCalibration installed (and in general PATH), and you need the zconfig.cfg files to have the appropriate parameters.
An example zconfig.cfg file is given in this folder. See this file for how to modify it. One of the doiAnalysis programs in this github needs to be compiled 
and put in PATH (doifit.cpp, see the file for compiling command), the others are script and only need to be copied in some folder in the PATH. 

The analysis procedure can be done manually or using the two scripts

- startAnalysis.sh --> takes care of step 1 and runs in parallel
- produceDatasets.sh --> takes care of step 2

WE STRONGLY SUGGEST using the scripts (see point B).

Finally, at the end of this file you can find the format of the output files that will be produced by this analysis.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A) MANUAL PROCEDURE:

- first analyze the y one by one

go to the yN folder, prepare the zconfig.cfg files in such a way that the right mppc numbers are selected etc. See example of relevant lines here:

# doi tagging bench
usingTaggingBench = 1      # if this is a tagging DOI bench measurement, put 1, otherwise 0
taggingPosition = 13.6     # position of the tagging bench in mm 
taggingCrystalChannel = 16  
digiChannelsForDoi = 12,13,14,15
doiColumnOffset = 1        # for DOI output, fix the column i by adding this quantity. if not stated, 0 by default

IMPORTANT - doiColumnOffset has to be chosen between 0 and 1 (or more) according the the real column under investigation in this y. otherwise it's always interpreted as 0 (i.e. the leftmost column of crystals in this mppc)

- Then from the yN folder start the dataset analysis

for j in z0 z1 z2 z3 z4; do cd $j/Run*/; ModuleCalibration -c zconfig.cfg `ls TTree_*` ; cd ../../; done

afterwards, move the doiData files

for i in y0 y1 y2 y3 y4 y5 y6 y7 ; do for j in z0 z1 z2 z3 z4; do cp $i/$j/Run*/doiData.txt $i/$j/doiData.txt ; done; done

and do the doi analysis for each yN with

doifit

from the yN folder. This produces a calibration_params.txt and a doi.txt file for each yN folder, then copy them in the "all" folder: from the DOI_scan folder do 

for i in y0 y1 y2 y3 y4 y5 y6 y7 ; do cp $i/calibration_params.txt ./all/${i}calibration_params.txt ; cp $i/doi.txt ./all/${i}doi.txt; done

and cat them to single files: from the all folder do

for i in y0 y1 y2 y3 y4 y5 y6 y7 ; do  cat ${i}calibration_params.txt >> calibration_params.txt; done
for i in y0 y1 y2 y3 y4 y5 y6 y7 ; do  cat ${i}doi.txt >> doi.txt; done
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



B) AUTOMATIC PROCEDURE:

You need to prepare the zconfig files properly anyway, so see the first step of manual procedure (A)
Then, running startAnalysis.sh and produceDatasets.sh will do everything. Check those files for instructions.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


C) OUTPUT FILES STRUCTURE

The analysis produces some text files as output. They are in the all_zconfig folder that will be created by the automatic macros (or by you if you do it manually). 
It's just two types of files: 

- calibration_params 
- doi

The ones without any yN in the name are the global ones, the others are specific to one y.

- calibration_params.txt file:
Contain data of the individual w points, crystal by crystal. Each row is a crystal and has:
i  j  m  q  doiRes  averageSigma  w0  sigma0  sqrt_nentries0  w1  sigma1  sqrt_nentries1  .......  wN  sigma1N  sqrt_nentries1N
where
i j                           are the i j coordinates of the crystal in the array (both start from 0 at bottom left, increasing)
m q                           are the inclination and offset of the linear fit of the N points in this crystal (w,z). beware that this z are the uncorrected one 
doiRes  averageSigma          doi resolution of this crystal calculated with m and average of the w sigmas in this crystals. And the value of average w sigma in this crystal. Values in mm, doi is FWHM
w0                            mean of the gaussian fit of the w histogram for this point, for crystal 0 
sigma0                        sigma of the gaussian fit of the w histo for this point, for crystal 0   
sqrt_nentries0                square root of the number of entries in the w histo for this point, for crystal 0 
The last 3 values are repeated for as many many times as many points were taken in the vertical scan.

- doi.txt file:
Only lists the doi res per crystal. Not very useful
Data is organized like this

i  j  doires  doiResError
